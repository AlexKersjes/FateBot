Default Folder for players is `PCs`, for GMs is `NPCs`\n        `ls` or `list` displays the Folders you have access to and their contents.\n        `store`, `stash`, `i`, `ice`, or `icebox` can be used to store a character in a Folder. Syntax: `ice <destination folder name>`.\nThe icebox command also takes options, prefixed by `-`. `a`, `s`, or `c` will attempt to icebox a matching fractal from your Aspects, Stunts, or Conditions respectively. Including `r` will permanently delete the fractal rather than icebox.\n        `l`, `load`, `get`, or skipping the identifier will attempt to Load a character. Syntax: `load <target folder> string`, where \'string\' matches a character\'s name\nThe load command also takes options, prefixed by `-`. `cp` will load a copy, leaving the original in the folder. `a`, `s`, or `c` will set the fractal as an Aspect, Stunt, or Condition respectively.\n        `mv` or `move` can be used to move an entry from one folder to another. Syntax: `move <targetFolderName> destinationFolderName string`, where string matches an entry in the target folder, or default folder if no target was given.\n        `switch` or `swap` will attempt to match a fractal on your sheet, and swap them. The fractal becomes your active character, and your active character becomes a fractal on your new active character\'s sheet.';
